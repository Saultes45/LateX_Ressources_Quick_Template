# LateX_Ressources_Quick_Template
This is a personal repo that contains mainly LaTeX code that I 
used over and over again and yet fail to remember it exactly. This ends up with some error trying 
to replicate it by memory. This repo is a (hopefully the best) solution to my memory problem. 
In this repo, I will put all the template code I feel I use for every LaTeX project. 
You are welcome to take it and make it you own. I sincerely hope it is going to help you.
